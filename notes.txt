* Multistage Docker build
* Distroless Images => A Distroless image has its own run time only

Note: We need Multistage Dockerfiles to reduce size of the Images

********* Lets say we have a calculator app written in python so we start writing docker file   ********

FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /app
RUN basic commands to install python and its dependency 
COPY . .
CMD [commands to run this app]


In the above Dockerfile why do we need ubuntu as base image we need ubuntu or any OS to run the the python commands only and to run the application hence
here comes the concept of Multistage docker builds
See the dockerfile for reference
